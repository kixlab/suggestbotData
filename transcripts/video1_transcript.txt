well the kid that sold it to me said

it's gonna be about $80 a month and

here's my first bill for 200. I got you.

know, just go ahead and shut this off and

do whatever you need to do with that

because I'm not paying it all right. Well

just give me just a second and I'll go

over this bill with you. we'll see what's

going on. to start off with this right

here the activation fee was just

something I didn't know anything about.

how a $30 package is costing me $45

a month. how I didn't sign up for

whatever road side is and I don't

know, I don't know, what half this stuff

is. I’m, you know, I'm going to explain

this totally to you. don't worry about it.

I just wanna cancel it. you take a phone back and

shred the bill if you want takes I'm not

playing it. well just let me take a look

at it, okay. I'm gonna take care of you,

okay, all right. we pull up Christie while

we receive, we're gonna help you out. my

name… my name.. I don't even need a service here.

I'm telling you this kid is in here the

other day lied to me about everything

else. all right I mean you want we'll

take care of it. right around the corner all right

Isn’t it, I have a nice

store right around the corner. I'm not

sure. I do.. but you again yeah that's what

we can learn. that's where I guess I’ll

go. we'll take care of you.

it'll be our, let's move your canopy on. I,

we're just gonna look. what did he look

like or.. I don't know. okay.. All right we are fine.

we'll take care of you. here's

your’s… can you just tell me why the bill

is, can you not look at the bill and just

tell me why it’s.. Oh huh is why are you

gonna pull up my account. well we just

want to make sure.. no.. we want all the

information so.. just hit cancel on it..

no I mean we just want to make sure we

have all the information because we want

you to be happy and we want you to be

satisfied with your service. there's

probably, it's probably just a

miscommunication.

we'll get in here and we'll get it taken

care of it'll be okay, all right. here's

the setup it Gregg sold it hmmm, yeah

all right. well, Gregg should explain this

stuff to to you ma'am. I'm going to show

you what your Bill is, okay.

M not paying it. okay, what happens is you

have your prorated on the.. don't have to

talk to me like I'm an idiot.

I'm not ma'am. I'm just trying to explain

the bill to you, what Gregg should have

and he's a new employee and you know..

they seem even more trying.. yes I agree.

great okay he needs to be trained better

before he hits the sales board. okay well, let

his manager know. we will, it's there's no

problem. but I my goal is to make you

satisfied. okay, I'm gonna take care of

you. I feel down by.. taking ownership of this

I'm going to make care of you. okay.. okay..

okay, you happy? not sure. my name's Scott.

my name is Christy. yes ma'am. okay, all

right, right here you've got an

activation fee okay, he should have told

you that straight up front okay. it's a

$36 activation fee. not paying it. we can

wait just, we can probably look into

getting this waived if you'll just give

me a second. we might be able to do that.

yeah, and I mean in fact the activation fee it

wouldn't matter. you know, if he explained

it properly or not. and we have one.

Verizon has one. every carrier has this,

same type of fee. I wasn't told. okay I mean

we're and we're really understand that.

I'm gonna, I'm definitely gonna let.. will

explain this to you, let's show you what

it is, and then we'll look at it and

we'll see what we can do. see if I can

get you a courtesy credit or we'll do

some.. we can do something for.. what we

want you to be happy we want you to keep

your service. well, do you like your phone?

do you like your phone? I haven't had

a chance to enjoy it because of this

bill. okay well I understand that but

it's really nice phone. I have the same phone myself.

anyhow about my bill. okay what we

have right here is a proration charges

okay. okay.

your proration charges since you began

this on, the fifteenth of the month, okay.

your prorated this amount okay. okay, all

right so your prorated this amount.. so

it's going to be $45 for this package 

every month. well how it works is your

billing cycle starts in the 15th and you

bought the phone on the first.

okay, so when you first get your bill

they.. and he should have explained this

to you he didn’t. and you get..

you're always paying a month in advance

for your service so in January you're

actually paying for February service.

so the first bill your..

it's the first bill? yes ma'am. yes ma'am

it's just going to be 

harsh bill ever. okay, your first bill

is always your harsh bill. so you.. you're

billed from the 1st to the 15th and then

you're billed that first month in

advance.

so you're actually not, some people

think they're paying double bill, you're

actually just.. you're paying a month

advance for your service. so they billed

you from the day you started. and then

you know, the normal billing cycle. they

bill you in advance for your service. so

what is that's correct roadside and

navigator? what are these things? roadside

assistance.. as do, you do know what

triple-a is? mm-hmm

okay do you have triple-a? no, I don’t.

okay well triple-a, like you know, it

covers, like if you have a flat tire, if

you run out of gas, some things like that..

I didn't sign up for it. okay well, we can..

it's only $2.99 a month and I

mean it's actually a really useful. so

follows the phone like if you were with

your grandmother or your mother and

they've had a flat tire and as long as

you have your phone with you

you got covered. so there's no charge you.

just call them up they come. they'll give

you gas. they'll jump start your car.

they'll fix the flat for you. unlock your

keys. I wouldn't have that in my bill then.

what we're going to do is, I'm actually, I

believe I can call customer service that

you wouldn't told properly and on your

bill I can get this $36 activation fee

waived, okay. after that it's going

to be under the $80 like that? yes ma'am

and yes man we'll go and we can show you

every charge you're going to have on

your bill, okay, per month okay. and if

there's something on there you don't

like we'll take it off or.. no problem. but

there's certain things like the roadside

and you know,

the Navigator, the att navigator

they put you on, they're actually very

useful features. he just didn't show you

how to use that. well worth, they

were worth the money and so he'll.. he'll

go ahead and call customer service. I'm

actually going to call my manager to see

if there's anything we can do for you

here. you know, to keep you on with us

because we do want your business we

appreciate it. and we're sorry that he

misinformed you on it. so I'm gonna call

a manager see if we can do. see if

there's some sort of, you know, courtesy

pass. I apologize first. you're fine you're fine darling.

we are taking care of. you okay. I'm sorry

that you wasn't informed but we want to

keep your service okay and this is

awesome phone and I won't show you how

to use it okay? okay? okay. let me call

customer service all right.

yeah. I got a customer here and was not

correctly tell her

when our first bill was going to be..

she's really upset she wants to cancel.

yes. 731.. and we did ..6182374.

I'm authorized 18 to retain.. she doesn't

have any accessories.. sure and something

okay. thanks. yes she was misinformed

on the the $36 activation fee and I need

to get that away for her

yes she.. he was a new employee. yes. she

wasn't fully trained on the bill how.. so

each bill here act as.. is going

to be about what? all right,

you've got your.. you got your a plan,

yes you've got the smartphone feature.

all right miss Wallace I've got your

activation fee waived all right so

that's 36 bucks off and it's gonna take

about four hours for it to actually show

on your bill, okay. so it's going to

be, go ahead and knock that off. just

forget about that okay. okay

did you talk to.. yeah what he said is we

could go ahead and.. what.. any accessories

that you want cuz I noticed Greg didn’t..

he didn't say any accessories with it, is

now.. this is a very nice phone and it

needs to be protected. it's worth about

$500 you know. that phone is. so what he

told me I could do is, any accessories

that you want, I can give you 20% off you

know. so if you need, you.. definitely if I

was you, you know get the case, a car

charger you know. because if you

probably.. and I noticed you didn't sign

you up for insurance either if you drop

that phone and break it it cost about

$400. What about warranty.. what warranty

will cover, it let's just say your screen

quits working or something, you can..

warranty will cover that they'll send

you a new phone. but if you drop it and

break it, get it wet. you know, anything

like that, then won’t cover it .so an

insurance that only $4.99 a month, we get

you signed up for that. so you know that

would be good. when get you your

accessories. and he got your credit for

your activation fee, for your trouble,

again we're apologize really I'm sorry.

I appreciate thats help. that then what..

are you totally satisfied? I am. I'd like

to look at some accessories. oh yeah grab

your accessories. Here is your phone. thank you. thank

you. you have a wonderful day. Thanks.
